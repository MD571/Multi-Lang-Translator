**Free, Multiple Language Translator**

## About
   The project is a `Multiple Languaue Translator` which is a `python-based` application. The application generally listens to your speech and recognizes its language. Afterwards, it simultaneously translates the text into multiple languages(here, I implemented for three) and speaks the translated text as well. By using GUI, I made it easy for users to use.
   
## Features
* Recoreds the speech and detects its Languauge.
* Translates the speech into Multiple Languguaes.
* Speaks the Translated text in the respective Languaue.
